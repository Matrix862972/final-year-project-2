## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to comprehensively define the requirements for the Online Exam Proctoring System, ensuring a clear and mutual understanding among all stakeholdersâ€”including developers, testers, project managers, institutional IT staff, compliance officers, and end users (students and administrators). This SRS serves several key objectives:

- **Foundation for Development:** Provides a detailed blueprint for the design, implementation, and testing of the system, reducing ambiguity and minimizing the risk of misinterpretation.
- **Stakeholder Agreement:** Acts as a formal agreement between stakeholders, capturing all functional and non-functional requirements, constraints, and expectations.
- **Project Management:** Supports planning, resource allocation, and progress tracking throughout the software lifecycle.
- **Quality Assurance:** Establishes the basis for validation, verification, and acceptance criteria, ensuring the delivered system meets user needs and regulatory standards.
- **Compliance and Audit:** Documents requirements for privacy, security, and legal compliance (e.g., GDPR, FERPA), supporting institutional audits and risk management.
- **Change Management:** Facilitates controlled evolution of the system by providing a reference for future enhancements, maintenance, and troubleshooting.

The Online Exam Proctoring System itself is intended to:

- Enable secure, scalable, and automated monitoring of online exams.
- Detect and record suspicious behaviors using AI-powered video, audio, and screen analysis.
- Provide real-time and post-exam evidence for review by authorized personnel.
- Protect the integrity of remote assessments while respecting user privacy and accessibility needs.

### 1.2 Scope

The scope of the Online Exam Proctoring System encompasses the design, development, deployment, and maintenance of a secure, real-time, AI-powered web application for monitoring online exams. The system is intended for use by educational institutions, universities, certification bodies, and other organizations conducting remote assessments. Key aspects of the scope include:

- **Supported Use Cases:**

  - Proctoring of scheduled online exams for students, including real-time and post-exam review.
  - Automated detection of suspicious behaviors (e.g., multiple faces, device usage, audio violations, screen switching).
  - Evidence collection (video, audio) and secure storage for later review by authorized personnel.
  - Administrative dashboard for managing exams, reviewing results, and generating reports.
  - User authentication and role-based access for students and administrators.

- **Deployment:**

  - Designed for deployment on local machines or local institutional networks only (no cloud deployment in current version).
  - Supports small-scale deployments, such as single class or department-level exam sessions.

- **Users:**

  - Students (exam takers), administrators (proctors, reviewers), IT/compliance staff, and developers/maintainers.

- **System Boundaries:**

  - Interfaces with webcams, microphones, and browsers on user devices. The system requires direct access to these peripherals for real-time monitoring and evidence collection. Supported browsers include Chrome, Firefox, and Edge on Windows OS. The application does not support mobile or tablet browsers in the current version.
  - Operates within the local network or on a standalone machine, with all data transmission and storage remaining within the local environment to ensure privacy and compliance.
  - Does not include exam content creation or grading functionality (focus is on proctoring and monitoring). The system is designed to work alongside existing exam delivery platforms, but does not itself deliver questions or evaluate answers.
  - Provides a web-based dashboard for administrators and proctors, accessible only within the local network or on the host machine.
  - All evidence (video, audio, screenshots) is stored locally, with access restricted to authorized users only. No data is transmitted to external servers or cloud services.
  - The system logs all access and actions for audit and compliance purposes, but does not monitor or control network traffic outside its own application scope.
  - User devices must meet minimum hardware requirements (webcam: UVC compatible, microphone: standard input, CPU: dual-core or better, RAM: 4GB+ recommended).
  - The system does not interact with or monitor other applications on the user's device, except for detecting screen/tab switching as part of proctoring.
  - No integration with third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services is present; all processing is performed locally.

**Out of Scope:**

- Mobile/tablet support: The current version is designed and tested exclusively for desktop and laptop environments, due to hardware access limitations and security concerns on mobile platforms. Support for mobile/tablet devices may be considered in future releases if secure and reliable monitoring can be ensured.
- Third-party exam platforms: Direct integration with external exam delivery or learning management systems (LMS) is not included in this version. The system is intended to operate independently or alongside such platforms, but does not provide built-in APIs or plugins for third-party services. Future versions may include integration capabilities based on user demand and security evaluation.
- Manual proctoring: The system is designed for automated and semi-automated proctoring workflows only. It does not provide features for live human proctors to monitor students in real time, such as video conferencing or chat. All monitoring and evidence collection are performed by the system's AI modules, with post-exam review by authorized personnel.
- Exam content management: Creation, editing, and grading of exam questions are outside the scope of this system. The focus is solely on monitoring and proctoring during exam sessions.
- Cloud-based deployment: The current version does not support deployment on public or private cloud infrastructure. All components and data remain within the local network or host machine for privacy and compliance reasons.
- Analytics and advanced reporting: While basic reporting and evidence review are included, advanced analytics, dashboards, and statistical analysis features are not part of the initial release.

**Extensibility:**
The system is designed with a modular, loosely-coupled architecture, enabling rapid development and integration of new features without disrupting existing functionality. Key aspects of extensibility include:

- **Plugin Support:** New detection modules, analytics engines, or hardware integrations can be added as plugins or separate modules, minimizing the need to modify core code.
- **API and Integration Points:** Well-defined internal APIs and data interfaces allow for seamless integration with external systems, such as LMS platforms or institutional authentication services, in future versions.
- **Configurable Workflows:** System workflows (e.g., violation detection, evidence storage, reporting) are designed to be configurable, supporting custom rules or additional steps as requirements evolve.
- **Example Future Enhancements:**
  - Additional detection modules (e.g., eye tracking, keystroke analysis, environmental sound detection, behavioral biometrics)
  - Advanced analytics, customizable dashboards, and real-time alerting
  - Deeper integration with learning management systems (LMS) or exam delivery platforms for unified user experience
  - Support for new hardware (e.g., biometric devices, multi-camera setups)
  - Expanded accessibility features (screen reader support, localization, alternative input methods)
  - Cloud or hybrid deployment options for scalability and remote access
  - Automated compliance reporting and audit trail exports

These enhancements can be incorporated with minimal changes to the core system, ensuring long-term adaptability, maintainability, and scalability as user needs and technology evolve.

**Real-Time Monitoring:**

- **Video Monitoring:**

  - Face detection and verification: Uses computer vision (OpenCV, MediaPipe) to ensure the registered student is present throughout the exam. Alerts and records evidence if the face is not detected or does not match the registered user.
  - Head movement tracking: Monitors for excessive or suspicious head movements (e.g., looking away from the screen repeatedly), which may indicate cheating attempts. Events are logged and video clips are saved as evidence.
  - Multiple person detection: Detects the presence of more than one person in the camera frame using AI models (e.g., YOLO). Triggers a violation and records video evidence if additional faces or bodies are detected.
  - Device detection: Identifies unauthorized electronic devices (e.g., phones, tablets) visible in the camera frame. Detected events are logged and video evidence is captured for review.

- **Audio Monitoring:**

  - Voice activity detection: Monitors for unexpected speech or conversation during the exam. Uses audio analysis (PyAudio) to detect and log voice activity, flagging possible collaboration or external assistance.
  - Noise detection: Identifies unusual background noises (e.g., other people talking, electronic device sounds) that may indicate a breach of exam conditions. Audio clips are recorded as evidence.
  - Conversation detection: Attempts to distinguish between the student speaking to themselves and speaking to others, flagging suspicious interactions for review.

- **Screen Monitoring:**
  - Tab/app switch detection: Monitors browser and system events to detect when the user switches away from the exam window or opens unauthorized applications. Each event is logged with a timestamp.
  - Window focus monitoring: Ensures the exam window remains the active window; loss of focus is recorded as a potential violation.
  - Shortcut monitoring: Detects the use of keyboard shortcuts (e.g., copy, paste, print screen) that may be used to cheat or capture exam content. Such actions are logged and may trigger alerts.

All real-time monitoring modules operate in parallel, with detected violations immediately logged and associated evidence (video/audio clips, screenshots, event logs) securely stored for post-exam review by administrators.
