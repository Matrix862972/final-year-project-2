### üß† Purpose: Global variables, Flask app initialization, and MySQL database configuration.

````python

app.config['MYSQL_PASSWORD'] = 'password'
app.config['MYSQL_DB'] = 'examproctordb'
mysql = MySQL(app)
# Initializes MySQL connection to a local database named `examproctordb`
# Thread Pool Executor
executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4)
# Allows running background tasks (e.g., face detection, logging) on up to 4 parallel threads

## üì∑ Function: capture_by_frames

### Purpose
This function is responsible for capturing real-time webcam frames, detecting faces using Haar Cascades, drawing rectangles around detected faces, and streaming the video feed to the web browser in MJPEG format.

---

### Code with Line-by-Line Explanation

```python
# Function to show face detection's Rectangle in Face Input Page
def capture_by_frames():  # Defines the streaming function for face detection preview
    global camera  # Uses the global variable `camera` (if initialized elsewhere)

    # Initializes the video capture with the default webcam using DirectShow backend (for Windows)
    utils.cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0, cv2.CAP_DSHOW)
    while True:  # Starts an infinite loop to continuously capture and process frames
        success, frame = utils.cap.read()  # Attempts to read a frame from the webcam

### Purpose
This function initializes multiple cheat detection subsystems (video, face recognition, and audio monitoring) by launching them in background threads using `ThreadPoolExecutor`. It is automatically called before processing each HTTP request.

---
### Code with Line-by-Line Explanation

```python
# Function to run Cheat Detection when we start run the Application

# This decorator tells Flask to call the function before every incoming request
@app.before_request
def start_loop():  # Defines the function that launches background detection modules

    # Submits cheat_Detection2() to the executor as a background thread.
    # Possibly handles one type of cheating behavior (e.g., posture analysis or eye tracking).
    task1 = executor.submit(utils.cheat_Detection2)

    # Submits another type of cheat detection algorithm.
    # It could handle a different modality like object detection or environment scanning.
    task2 = executor.submit(utils.cheat_Detection1)

    # Starts the facial recognition system from the utils.fr module.
    # Typically used to continuously verify student identity during the exam.
    task3 = executor.submit(utils.fr.run_recognition)

    # Starts audio recording or monitoring in a separate thread.
    # Likely used to detect background conversation or unauthorized help.
    task4 = executor.submit(utils.a.record)

    ## üîê Function: main (Login Route)

This route handles the default landing page (`'/'`) of the web application and displays the login interface to the user.

---

### **Code with Line-by-Line Explanation**

```python
# Login Related

# This Flask decorator maps the root URL to the main() function.
@app.route('/')
def main():  # Defines the view function for the homepage
    # Renders the login.html template from the templates/ folder
    return render_template('login.html')

## üîê Function: login (User Login Route)

### **Purpose**
Handles POST login requests from the login form, verifies credentials against the database, and redirects users to the appropriate page based on their role (STUDENT or ADMIN).

---

### **Code with Line-by-Line Explanation**

```python
# Route handler for '/login', only accepts POST requests
@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    global studentInfo  # Use global variable to store logged-in student info

    if request.method == 'POST':  # Confirm that request is a POST
        username = request.form['username']  # Get the entered username (email) from the login form
        password = request.form['password']  # Get the entered password from the login form

        cur = mysql.connection.cursor()  # Create a cursor object to interact with the database

        # ‚ö†Ô∏è SQL Injection risk! Use parameterized queries instead in production
        cur.execute("SELECT * FROM students where Email='" + username + "' and Password='" + password + "'")
        data = cur.fetchone()  # Fetch the first matching user record

        if data is None:  # No match found ‚Üí invalid login
            flash('Your Email or Password is incorrect, try again.', category='error')  # Show error message

                return redirect(url_for('rules'))  # Redirect to rules page before exam starts

            else:  # If user is an admin or teacher
                return redirect(url_for('adminStudents'))  # Redirect to admin student dashboard


## üîì Function: logout (User Logout Route)

### **Purpose**
Handles the logout route (`/logout`) by rendering the login page again. Currently, this function does **not** clear session data, so it does not securely log out the user.

---

### **Code with Line-by-Line Explanation**

```python
@app.route('/logout')



## üìò Route: /rules (Exam Rules Page)

### **Purpose**
This route displays the exam rules to students after they successfully log in, helping them understand the policies before they proceed with the test.

### **Code with Inline Comments**
```python
# Flask route to serve a continuous webcam stream using MJPEG format
@app.route('/video_capture')  # Endpoint to start streaming video
def video_capture():
    # Returns a Response object that streams webcam frames as JPEG images
    return Response(
        capture_by_frames(),  # Generator function yielding encoded image frames
        mimetype='multipart/x-mixed-replace; boundary=frame'  # MIME type for MJPEG streaming
    )



üñºÔ∏è Function: saveFaceInput
Purpose
Captures a frame from the webcam, saves it as the student's profile image, moves the image to the designated "Profiles" folder, and redirects to a confirmation page.

Code with Explanations
```python
# Route for saving the face input image
@app.route('/saveFaceInput')
def saveFaceInput():
    global profileName  # Use the global variable to store the profile image name

    # Check if the webcam (stored in utils.cap) is already in use
    if utils.cap.isOpened():
        utils.cap.release()  # Release it to prevent access conflict

    # Start a new webcam session using OpenCV
    cam = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

    # Capture a single frame from the webcam
    success, frame = cam.read()

    # Generate a unique filename using the student's name and a 3-digit result ID
    profileName = f"{studentInfo['Name']}_{utils.get_resultId():03}" + "Profile.jpg"

    # Save the captured frame to disk as a JPEG image
    cv2.imwrite(profileName, frame)

    # Move the saved image file into the "Profiles" folder for organization
    utils.move_file_to_output_folder(profileName, 'Profiles')

    # Release the webcam to free it for future use
    cam.release()

    # Redirect to the face input confirmation page
    return redirect(url_for('confirmFaceInput'))

## üì∏ Route: /confirmFaceInput
### **Purpose**
This route is responsible for:

Encoding the face image captured earlier (for recognition).

Displaying the face back to the student for confirmation before proceeding.

```python
# Route to confirm the face input taken previously
@app.route('/confirmFaceInput')
def confirmFaceInput():
    # Use the global variable that stores the filename of the captured profile image
    profile = profileName

    # Call the face recognition module's encode_faces() method to process the captured image.
    # This typically extracts face encodings so they can be matched during monitoring.
    utils.fr.encode_faces()

    # Render the confirmation page where the student can verify their captured photo
    return render_template('ExamConfirmFaceInput.html', profile=profile)


    üß™ Route: /systemCheck
Purpose
This route is used to render the System Check page, which ensures that the candidate's hardware and environment (e.g., webcam, microphone, internet) are ready for the proctored exam.


```python
# Flask route for the system check page
@app.route('/systemCheck')
def systemCheck():
    # Render the HTML template that allows candidates to check their system readiness
    # Typically includes webcam, microphone, screen resolution, and browser compatibility
    return render_template('ExamSystemCheck.html')

‚öôÔ∏è Route: /systemCheck (POST)
Purpose
This route handles the POST request made during the system check process. It receives system information (e.g., webcam, microphone status) from the frontend and responds with a status indicating whether the system is ready or not.

Code with Line-by-Line Comments
```python
# Flask route that listens for POST requests to /systemCheck
@app.route('/systemCheck', methods=["POST"])
def systemCheckRoute():
    # Check if the request method is POST
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # Get JSON data sent from frontend (likely system information)
        examData = request.json

        # Default output is set to "exam" (means system is OK)
        output = 'exam'

        # If any system input info contains 'Not available', set output to 'systemCheckError'
        if 'Not available' in examData['input'].split(';'):
            output = 'systemCheckError'

    # Return the result as JSON back to frontend
    return jsonify({"output": output})

‚ùå Route: /systemCheckError
Purpose
This route serves the system check error page when the user's hardware (like webcam/microphone) does not meet exam requirements.

Code with Comments
```python
# Route to handle system check failure

def systemCheckError():
    # Renders the error page informing the candidate their system check failed
    return render_template('ExamSystemCheckError.html')


Route: /exam
Purpose
This route initializes the actual exam session. It starts webcam capture and sets up a keyboard hook to monitor shortcut key usage (e.g., for copy/paste detection) and renders the main exam interface.

Code with Comments
```python
# Route to start the exam session
@app.route('/exam')
def exam():
    # Initializes webcam capture using the DirectShow backend for better Windows support
    utils.cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0, cv2.CAP_DSHOW)

    # Hooks into all keyboard input to detect prohibited shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl+C, Alt+Tab)
    keyboard.hook(utils.shortcut_handler)

    # Loads the main exam interface HTML page
    return render_template('Exam.html')


üß† examAction ‚Äì Exam Evaluation & Result Handling
Purpose
This function processes the submitted exam score, calculates the final marks and trust score, detects cheating, and generates the result with a status (Pass/Fail/Cheating). It also saves the result to a JSON file for records.

```python
@app.route('/exam', methods=["POST"])  # Define a POST route at '/exam'
def examAction():
    link = ''  # Initialize redirect link for result page

    if request.method == 'POST':  # Ensure it's a POST request
        examData = request.json  # Get JSON data from request body

        if examData['input'] != '':  # Proceed if exam input is not empty
            utils.Globalflag = False  # Stop any active monitoring threads

            utils.cap.release()  # Release webcam

            # Log any detected prohibited shortcuts
            utils.write_json({
                "Name": ('Prohibited Shorcuts (' + ','.join(list(dict.fromkeys(utils.shorcuts))) + ') are detected.'),
                "Time": (str(len(utils.shorcuts)) + " Counts"),
                "Duration": '',
                "Mark": (1.5 * len(utils.shorcuts)),  # Assign penalty marks
                "Link": '',
                "RId": utils.get_resultId()  # Unique result ID
            })

            utils.shorcuts = []  # Reset shortcut list

            trustScore = utils.get_TrustScore(utils.get_resultId())  # Get AI-determined trust score

            # Calculate final marks (scale input to 100)
            totalMark = math.floor(float(examData['input']) * 6.6667)

            # Apply rules based on trust score and total marks
            if trustScore >= 30:  # If cheating suspected
                status = "Fail(Cheating)"
                link = 'showResultFail'
            else:
                if totalMark < 50:  # If failed due to marks
                    status = "Fail"
                    link = 'showResultFail'
                else:  # Otherwise, passed
                    status = "Pass"
                    link = 'showResultPass'

            # Save final result to JSON file
            utils.write_json({
                "Id": utils.get_resultId(),
                "Name": studentInfo['Name'],
                "TotalMark": totalMark,
                "TrustScore": max(100 - trustScore, 0),  # Convert to positive trust score
                "Status": status,
                "Date": time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d", time.localtime(time.time())),
                "StId": studentInfo['Id'],
                "Link": profileName
            }, "result.json")

            # Format result status to send to frontend
            resultStatus = studentInfo['Name'] + ';' + str(totalMark) + ';' + status + ';' + time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d", time.localtime(time.time()))

        else:
            utils.Globalflag = True  # Keep monitoring running
            print('sfdsfsdsfdsfdsfdsfdsfdsfdsfds')  # Debug print (can be removed)
            resultStatus = ''  # Return empty result if input is empty

    # Return result and page link to frontend
    return jsonify({"output": resultStatus, "link": link})
üîé Notes
The trust score system provides an automated cheat-detection mechanism.

Use of utils.shorcuts allows keyboard-based violations to be penalized.

Result is saved as JSON ‚Äì suitable for later retrieval or dashboard rendering.

Debug text (print('sfdsfsdsfdsfdsfdsfdsfdsfdsfds')) is junk and should be cleaned.
